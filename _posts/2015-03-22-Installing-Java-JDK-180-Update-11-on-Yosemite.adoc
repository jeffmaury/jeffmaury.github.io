= Installing Java JDK 1.8.0 Update 11 on Yosemite

If you need to use Java JDK 1.8.0 Update 11 on Mac OS X Yosemite, you probably noticed that the installation provided by Oracle fails with a strange message:

*Java from Oracle requires Mac OS X 10.7.3 or later*

Mac OS X Yosemite is version *10.10.X*

So, if you need to use or test Java JDK 1.8.0 Update 11, you're stuck with the package provided by Oracle.

Here is how to proceed to use Java JDK 1.8.0 Update 11 on Mac OS X Yosemite.

== Download and install Pacifist

The workaround is based on the fact that the Mac OS *pkg* that is stored in the downloaded *dmg* file contains the JDK distribution. So if we manage to open it, there is a chance we can extract the files.

After having played with Mac OS tool called *pkgutil*, I found the best solution was to used another tool called *Pacifist*.

So, first, you need to install *Pacifist*. You can find the binary of the following url: https://www.charlessoft.com/cgi-bin/pacifist_download.cgi?type=dmg

Once you've downloaded the Pacifist *dmg* file, it should be opened in the Mac OS *Finder* and you just need to drag the *Pacifist.app* folder to the folder of your choice (*/Applications* is the recommanded one for Mac OS).

== Download and install Java JDK 1.8.0 Update 11

Download the *dmg* file from the following URL: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-archive-javase8-2177648.html#jdk-8u11-oth-JPR

Once you've downloaded the *dmg* file, open it. You should see a new volume called *JDK 8 Update 11*. Don't do anything and switch to the following phase.

== Run Pacifist and open the pkg file

Using the Mac OS Launchpad, launch *Pacifist* and open the *pkg* file that is located at the following path: */Volumes/JDK 8 Update 11/JDK 8 Update 11.pkg*. On Finder, then you should see *JDK 8 Update 11* under the *Devices*, so select this item and you should see the *JDK 8 Update 11.pkg* on the right pane of Finder. Double click on this file and you should see the following file:

In the tree that is displayed, select the *Contents of JDK 8 Update 11.pkg*, then click on the *Install* button. As the Java JDK will be installed in system libraries, then you need to select the *Use Administrator Privileges* checkbox and click the *Install* button.

If you see dialogs about existing file, click on the *Replace* or *Update* button.

When the installation is finished, *Java JDK 8 Update 11* will be installed under */Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_11.jdk*.

If you want to use it, see *JAVA_HOME* to */Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_11.jdk/Contents/Home*.

*Java JDK 8 Update 11* is now installed on Mac OS !!!
